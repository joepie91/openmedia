This video presentation advocates a new socio-economic system, which is updated to present-day knowledge, featuring the life-long work of Social Engineer, Futurist, Inventor and Industrial Designer Jacque Fresco, which he calls a Resource-Based Economy.\n\nThe film details the need to outgrow the dated and inefficient methods of politics, law, business, or any other \"establishment\" notions of human affairs, and use the methods of science, combined with high technology, to provide for the needs of all the world's people. It is not based on the opinions of the political and financial elite or on illusionary so-called democracies, but on maintaining a dynamic equilibrium with the planet that could ultimately provide abundance for all people.\n\nParadise or Oblivion, by The Venus Project, introduces the viewer to a more appropriate value system that would be required to enable this caring and holistic approach to benefit human civilization. This alternative surpasses the need for a monetary-based, controlled, and scarcity-oriented environment, which we find ourselves in today.\n\nIf you would like to help with the creation of a translation for this and/or other TVP videos, please write to LinguisticTeam@thevenusproject.com",

The film presents a 9/11 conspiracy theory to set forth the claim that elements within the United States government planned and executed the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. The film was released through the creators' company, Louder than Words, and received wide attention after Loose Change 2nd Edition was featured on a Binghamton, New York local FOX affiliate, WICZ-TV (FOX 40).[1] It is one of the most watched films on the Internet, with over 10 million viewers in 2006.[2]\n\nThe accuracy and fairness of Loose Change has been disputed by Popular Mechanics, media outlets and independent researchers. On September 11, 2006 Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas appeared on \"Democracy Now! the War and Peace Report\", to debate James Meigs and David Dunbar,[3] two editors of Popular Mechanics and the book Debunking 9/11 Myths.[4] The film has been edited and re-released in a second edition, then recut again removing some of the inaccuracies that were in previous editions. A further \"final cut\" version was originally planned for release on September 11 2006, but was delayed and is now pushed back to February or March 2007.",
